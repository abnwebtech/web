# Demo AngularJS Front End application 
Author: Makhtar Diouf<makhtar.diouf@gmail.com>

- The main source code is under the app/ directory.
- I suppose the underlying data is available in JSON format,
 as simulated in Code/app/data/list.json.

- Icon images for Builds/Firewalls were sliced from the design snippet, 
and blended with the background color corresponding to the item's state. 
- The jpg format is used to reduce file sizes.

### Toolset

This application is built with: 
- Twitter Bootstrap 3 CSS framework for the overall responsive layout.
- Angular MVC Javascript framework, version 1.2 for IE8 support.
- Google Charts for plotting metrics.


### Prerequisites
You must have `node.js` and its package manager `npm` installed.  
They are available from [http://nodejs.org/].

From the Code directory, run:
```
npm install
```
- It will execute "bower install" behind the scenes.
